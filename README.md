First Repo

On Saturday, 23rd January 2021. I liked someone but it seems that it's difficult to catch her.
Right now, I can not be sure that I can keep following her until she turn back to see me.
Dejected, Dissappointed, Pessimistic. These negative feelings just overwhelm me, which makes me doubt myself.
That makes me wonder if I can continue chasing after her.
haahaa
